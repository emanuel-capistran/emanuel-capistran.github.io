CSS Zen Garden is a great site that shows us the power of CSS. 
Most site submissions in Zen Garden are great, but there are some exceptions
that lack design. I will start with the site that I disliked the most. <span style="color:green";><i>Spring360
by Rene Hornig</i></span> its too simple and one of the least interesthing sites found in 
Zen Garden. There site could use more graphics, like images or nice stylized 
backgrounds. The text found in Spring360 is very plain compared to the other sites 
in Zen Garden. It almost looks like the default typeface.
</br></br>
<span style="font-size:17px";><i>Here is an example of how the text in the site looks like</i></span>
</br></br> 
<span style="font-family: Verdana,Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;color:black;">
"There is a continuing
need to show the power of CSS. The Zen Garden aims to excite, inspire, and encourage
participation. To begin, view some of the existing designs in the list. Clicking on 
any one will load the style sheet into this very page"
</span>
</br></br>
The right side bar stops half way down the body of the site, this makes the site 
look unbalanced. You are scrolling down but suddenly the side bar ends but your eyes 
want to continue following that sidebar down. The color scheme works but its not enough 
to make the site better.</br>
</br>
Now lets talk about <span style="color:blue;"><i>Under the Sea! by Eric Stultz</i></span>. This site caught my attention 
from the very first time I look at it. It has great graphics and the text matches the 
theme of the site. The right side bar ends like <span style="color:green;"><i>Spring360</i></span>,but if you continue to scroll 
down there are images that make your eyes don't mind that the side bar has ended. 
I like the static bottom image, it almost makes the text feel like a scroll. The body text is 
nicely stylized making it enjoyable to look.
