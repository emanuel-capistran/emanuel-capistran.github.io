			<h3><span style="color:yellow">About Me</span></h3>
			<p>
			I am a young graphic designer with a passion for art. Since I was young, drawing</br>
			was something that I enjoyed. I wanted to be able to draw the worlds from my imagination.</br>
			It was until I finished High School that I decided to take art as my career. My inspiration</br>
			has always been the epic universes found in video games and in trading card games. When I</br>
			started college, my knowledge of typography was poor. After taking a couple of courses in</br>
			typography I discovered a world that I had no idea it existed. I enjoy combining both</br>
			digital art with typography in my art work.
