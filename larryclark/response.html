		Larry Clark emphathiced as well as socialized with the younger generation of rebel teenagers
		and young adults. his photography has been described by critics as "exposing the reality of 
		American suburban life at the fringe and ... shattering long-held mythical conventions that 
		drugs and violence were an experience solely indicative of the urban landscape." My response
		to Clark's work is my own series of photographs about the types of games me and my friends 
		played while growing up (my gaming evolution).
