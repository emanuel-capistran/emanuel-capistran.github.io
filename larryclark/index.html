	<h1>Larry Clark</h1>
	<p>
		Larry Clark is an American photographer and film director. He learned photography at an early age
		of 13. In 1959, he began to use drugs with his friends. He would carry a camera with him and take
		pictures of his drug addiction. His explicit portrayals of teenagers and young adults have been 
		highly influential on contemporary photography. His service in the Vietnam War led him to write 
		<em>Tusla(1971)</em>. He followed with <em>Teenage Lust(1987)</em>, an autobiography of his teenage years past through 
		the images of others. He then constructed a photographic essay titled <em>The Perfect Childhood(1993)</em>.
		They all centre on a self-destructive combination of sex, drugs, and violence in the hands of young 
		people. He started to become well known to a wider audience after the release of his independent film 
		<em>Kids</em> in 1995. His work not only became well known, but it also had influence in fashion photography.
