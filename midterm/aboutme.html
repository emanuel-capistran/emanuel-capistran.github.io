		<h1>About Me</h1>
		Welcome to my website. I am a Graphic Designer and Illustrator.
		I am currently attending The City Collge of New York. Since I was
		young I have always liked to draw. As I was growing up, trading 
		card games became my inspiration. I wanted to become an artist, in
		order to make illustrations just like the ones in card games. When I started 
		college I discovered the world of typography. I like incorporating text
		phrases into my art work.
